    <p class="bio-copy">Hello and thanks for following a link to my site and then deciding to read to the footer! I'm Winston. To make a living and pay the bills, I work on the front-end of websites. I work to make them performant and accessible, while trying to understand how to build things in user-friendly and developer-friendly forms. There is so much to learn!</p>
    <p class="bio-copy">Once the living has been made, I love reading good literature, riding my bike, and exploring the world with my family. We spent April 2013 - September 2014 road-tripping around the country, exploring cities and national parks, and we're itching to travel again.</p>
