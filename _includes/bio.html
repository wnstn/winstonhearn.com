<section class="bio">
  <p>I'm a person who reads and writes and tries to fumble towards a better understanding of everything. This site is where I collect my thoughts on books I'm reading, the tech-driven world we're building, and anything else I find interesting. I currently work for <a href="https://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> as a Sr. Front End Engineer. I don't know how to write bios.</p>
