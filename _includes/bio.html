  <p>Winston Hearn, who is me, is a person who reads and writes and fumbles towards better questions to ask. This site is where I collect my thoughts on books I'm reading, the tech-driven world we're building, and anything else I find interesting. I currently work for <a href="https://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a> as a Sr. Front End Engineer.</p>
