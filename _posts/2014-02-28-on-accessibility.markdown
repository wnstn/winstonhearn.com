>This is a big problem with development these days. With a lack of time and budget, a lot of accessibility "testing" really falls on whether the designer and developer of a page or application can, well, access it. Designs then become focused on aesthetics only, with low contrast being seen as more pleasant to those who have excellent vision; tools become tiny because that makes them cute and out of the way for more content. It's 2014 and we continue to build a Web for what we consider to be the group most worthy of access: able-bodied, good-sight-and-hearing-having people, in a class that can afford high-bandwidth and memory for large asset loading sites.
