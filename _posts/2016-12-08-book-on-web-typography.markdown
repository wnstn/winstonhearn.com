A small, incredibly informative book that gives you what feels like a comprehensive education on the importance and language of typography and then a great deal of practical advice for choosing and using typefaces. Jason knows his shit and knows how to teach you what he knows. This book is a fantastic for anyone seeking to understand more about typography and how to improve your typographic design skills. If you're an amateur like me, you'll learn so much, but I imagine there is much to be learned in here for those who have been working with type for years. This is a fast read but it packs a great deal of education inside.
