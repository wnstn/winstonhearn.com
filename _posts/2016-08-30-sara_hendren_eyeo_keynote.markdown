I am having trouble describing this keynote; it is delightful and thought-provoking and inspiring but those descriptors seem to diminish the talk. In this talk, [Sara Hendren](https://ablersite.org/about/), who describes herself as an artist and design researcher, presents three simple propositions for how to find and do meaningful work. The talk applies to design, to engineering, to humans who wish to make a dent in the universe. I'll be thinking about this for awhile.
