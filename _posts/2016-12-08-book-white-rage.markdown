 My hardcover copy of _White Rage_ has 229 numberd pages but the prose content ends on page 164. This is because Dr. Anderson, as the kids say, has the receipts. This short, straightforward book tells the story of America since the end of the civil war, the story of injustice after injustice being perpetrated against the black community in America. The story she tells – which as mentioned is incredibly well evidenced and sourced – is succinct and damning; every time black Americans have made progress or had hope of progress since the civil war has been met with resistance from white Americans through every possible avenue of attack.

 This history is our history but the shock of this book is that just as white Americans have worked to squelch black progress, we have worked to reframe the root of our actions or deny our motivations. These alternate histories are the ones taught in schools. This book is a sharp antidote to the poisonous alternative histories we teach and believe. Dr. Anderson has done the work that should have never been necessary; using her time and immense talents to tell the stories that white America has cowardly tried to forget.
