This post is meant to complement the talk I'm giving at [CoderFaire](http://tennessee.coderfaire.com/) on September 20, 2014. Hopefully you got to see it in person, but if not, I will maybe write out the full talk sometime soon. In the meantime, here are some links that I found helpful while researching the talk.

- [The Promises/A+ Spec](http://promisesaplus.com/)

   It's surprisingly short and easy to digest. Worth reading!
   
- [Javascript Promises in Wicked Detail](http://www.mattgreer.org/articles/promises-in-wicked-detail/)

   Super great technical article that helps you write out a basic A+ compliant Promises library. Similar to reading the code, except you're writing it and having it explained as you go.
   
- [HTML5 Rocks Promises Tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/)

   Always love the HTML5 stuff!
   
- [Patterns for Asynchronous Programming with Promises](http://www.joezimjs.com/javascript/patterns-asynchronous-programming-promises/)

    Helpful for trying to wrap your head around nesting and chaining.

- [Comparison of Javascript Libraries](http://complexitymaze.com/2014/03/03/javascript-promises-a-comparison-of-libraries/)

   Super quick comparison of all the libraries that have Promises and promise-like capabilities.

- [Callbacks, Promises, Signals, and Events](http://blog.millermedeiros.com/callbacks-promises-signals-and-events/)

    Great explanatory article for when to use different Javascript patterns.

- [Promise Anti-Patterns](http://taoofcode.net/promise-anti-patterns/)

    Promises make it easy to do some dumb things, this post addresses a few anti-patterns and their solutions.
