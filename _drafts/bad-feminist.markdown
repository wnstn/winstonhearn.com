I hope you have heard of Roxane Gay. She is [having a moment](http://www.vqronline.org/essays-articles/2014/10/price-black-ambition). She is delightful [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/rgay). She rambles and gives advice [on Tumblr](http://roxanegay.tumblr.com). She writes essays everywhere, it seems. She is soon to be the Editor-in-chief (proprietor? maintainer-of-awesomeness?) at [The Butter](http://the-butter.net/) a new vertical of The Toast. She also writes fiction and her recent novel [An Untamed State](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802122515/?tag=wnshea-20) is a NYT Bestseller. I have not read it. I hope to soon.

I have read Bad Feminist and I will be reflecting on it for quite awhile. Gay writes powerful, eloquent prose that covers many topics in modern life. Her voice is empathetic, open, and yet also authoritative and impossible to dismiss. She explores the language of sexual violence, the HBO show _Girls_, the film and book series _The Hunger Games_, and the various ways that feminism intersects with race, gender, and sexuality.

I can only commend you to obtain and read this book for yourself. There is no praise I can place upon it, nothing I can say about it that will improve upon Gay's prose. When you read it, I look forward to hearing what stood out to you the most, because there is so much within it that guided and improved my thinking on a multitude of topics.
