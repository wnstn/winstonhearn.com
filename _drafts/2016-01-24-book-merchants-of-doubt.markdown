my-excerpt: What if the most controversial scientific issues in public policy in the past half century weren't actually controversial? This book lays out a well-documented case that specific scientists conspired to influence issues ranging from the danger of smoking, the influence of CFC's on the Ozone, to the ongoing denial of climate change.
